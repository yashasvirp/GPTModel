# GPTModel
Building a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) from scratch

This is an attempt to understand and learn how large language models are built and trained on data.

Built on following a Youtube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU1WVnMk4E8&t=597s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) by freecodecamp.

Learning and building is still in progress. Will update it soon, and provide my learnings here.
